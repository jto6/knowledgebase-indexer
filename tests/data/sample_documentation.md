## Getting Started

Welcome to the comprehensive development guide. This section covers everything you need to know to get started with development.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin development, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- **Python 3.8+**: The core runtime for our application
  - pip: Package installer
  - virtualenv: Virtual environment support
  - pytest: For running tests
- **Node.js 16+**: For frontend development
  - npm: Node package manager
  - webpack: Module bundler
- **Git**: Version control system
- **Docker**: For containerization
  - docker-compose: For multi-container applications

### Environment Setup

Setting up your development environment involves several steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/company/project.git
   cd project
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   # or
   venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   npm install
   ```

## Architecture Overview

Our system follows a modern microservices architecture with clear separation of concerns.

### System Components

The system is composed of several key components:

#### Frontend Application

The frontend is built using React and TypeScript:

- **Component Library**: Reusable UI components
  - Button components with multiple variants
  - Form controls with validation
  - Data display components
- **State Management**: Redux for global state
  - Actions and reducers
  - Middleware for async operations
- **Routing**: React Router for navigation
- **Build System**: Webpack with optimization

#### Backend Services

The backend consists of multiple microservices:

- **API Gateway**: Routes requests to appropriate services
- **User Service**: Handles user management and authentication
  - User registration and login
  - Profile management
  - Permission handling
- **Product Service**: Manages product catalog
  - Product CRUD operations
  - Category management
  - Inventory tracking
- **Order Service**: Processes orders and payments
  - Order creation and tracking
  - Payment processing
  - Fulfillment workflows

#### Data Layer

Data persistence is handled through:

- **PostgreSQL**: Primary relational database
  - User data
  - Product information
  - Order records
- **Redis**: Caching layer
  - Session storage
  - API response caching
  - Rate limiting data

## API Reference

Our API follows REST principles with clear endpoint structure.

### Authentication Endpoints

Authentication is handled through JWT tokens:

```
POST /api/auth/login
POST /api/auth/register  
POST /api/auth/refresh
DELETE /api/auth/logout
```

### User Management

User-related operations:

```
GET /api/users - List all users
GET /api/users/{id} - Get specific user
POST /api/users - Create new user
PUT /api/users/{id} - Update user
DELETE /api/users/{id} - Delete user
```

### Product Management

Product catalog operations:

```
GET /api/products - List products
GET /api/products/{id} - Get product details
POST /api/products - Create product
PUT /api/products/{id} - Update product
DELETE /api/products/{id} - Delete product
```

## Development Workflow

Our development process follows industry best practices.

### Code Standards

We maintain high code quality through:

#### Python Code Style

- **PEP 8 compliance**: Follow Python style guidelines
- **Type hints**: Use type annotations for better code clarity
- **Docstrings**: Document all public functions and classes
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive exception handling

Example:
```python
def process_user_data(user_id: int, data: Dict[str, Any]) -> User:
    """
    Process and validate user data.
    
    Args:
        user_id: The ID of the user to update
        data: Dictionary containing user data to process
        
    Returns:
        Updated User object
        
    Raises:
        ValidationError: If data validation fails
        UserNotFoundError: If user doesn't exist
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

#### JavaScript/TypeScript Code Style

- **ESLint configuration**: Enforced linting rules
- **Prettier formatting**: Consistent code formatting
- **TypeScript strict mode**: Enhanced type safety
- **Component documentation**: JSDoc for React components

### Testing Strategy

We employ comprehensive testing at multiple levels:

#### Unit Testing

- **pytest**: For Python unit tests
- **Jest**: For JavaScript/TypeScript unit tests
- **Coverage targets**: Minimum 80% code coverage
- **Mock strategies**: Proper mocking of external dependencies

#### Integration Testing

- **API testing**: Test complete request/response cycles
- **Database testing**: Test data persistence and queries
- **Service integration**: Test inter-service communication

#### End-to-End Testing

- **Cypress**: For frontend E2E tests
- **API testing**: Complete workflow testing
- **Performance testing**: Load and stress testing

### Deployment Process

Our deployment follows CI/CD best practices:

#### Continuous Integration

- **GitHub Actions**: Automated builds and tests
- **Code quality gates**: Automated code review
- **Security scanning**: Dependency and vulnerability scanning

#### Deployment Stages

1. **Development**: Feature branch deployments
2. **Staging**: Pre-production testing environment
3. **Production**: Live system deployment

## Configuration Management

Configuration is managed through environment variables and configuration files.

### Environment Variables

Key environment variables:

```bash
# Database configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db
REDIS_URL=redis://host:port/0

# API configuration
API_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
JWT_EXPIRY_HOURS=24

# Feature flags
ENABLE_NEW_FEATURE=true
DEBUG_MODE=false
```

### Configuration Files

Configuration files for different environments:

- `config/development.yml`: Development settings
- `config/staging.yml`: Staging environment settings
- `config/production.yml`: Production configuration

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

### Database Connection Issues

If you encounter database connection problems:

1. Check database server status
2. Verify connection string
3. Check network connectivity
4. Review database logs

### API Performance Issues

For API performance problems:

1. Check response times in logs
2. Review database query performance
3. Analyze caching effectiveness
4. Monitor resource utilization

### Frontend Build Issues

If frontend builds fail:

1. Clear node_modules and reinstall
2. Check for TypeScript errors
3. Verify webpack configuration
4. Review dependency compatibility

## Best Practices

### Security Considerations

- **Input validation**: Validate all user inputs
- **Authentication**: Secure authentication mechanisms
- **Authorization**: Proper role-based access control
- **Data encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data

### Performance Optimization

- **Database indexing**: Optimize database queries
- **Caching strategies**: Implement effective caching
- **Code optimization**: Profile and optimize critical paths
- **Resource management**: Efficient resource utilization

### Monitoring and Logging

- **Application logging**: Comprehensive logging strategy
- **Error tracking**: Automated error reporting
